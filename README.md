# gene_mRNA_parser
Pyhton target gene mRNA parser from NCBI nucleotide database

This very simple and basic pyhton code takes a .gb file that can be downloaded from the NCBI nucleotide database and read each line to get the following information in a list:
1. Name of each protein encoded
2. Pair positions of each exon for the mRNA
3. The last element of the list is the complete DNA sequence
